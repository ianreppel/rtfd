Oracle SQL & PL/SQL optimization for developers is a `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation project initiated by `Ian Reppel <https://ianreppel.org>`_.
Its aim is to aid developers in writing efficient SQL & PL/SQL code for modern Oracle databases.
It is also a chronicle of successful and not so successful experiments as a developer for various production systems.

This public Git repository hosts the reStructuredText (reST) files needed to (automatically) build the documentation hosted on `RTD <http://readthedocs.org>`_.

The `default adornments <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html#sections>`_ for section headers are used:

* ``#`` (with overline) for parts
* ``*`` (with overline) for chapters
* ``=`` for sections
* ``-`` for subsections
* ``^`` for subsubsections
* ``"`` for paragraphs

Since the interpretation of these adornments is relative to each file in which they are used, it is recommended that all chapters belonging to a part, all sections belonging to a chapter, and so on, are, if defined in separate files, combined with the ``include`` directive at the highest level, i.e. (part, chapter, ...).
The ``include`` directive reads the contents of each file in the context of the document in which it is written.
Please check the source folder of the repository for examples.
